        <P>Endangered animals are those threatened with disappearing from Earth. Deforestation, climate change, illegal<br> hunting and animal trafficking are some of the reasons that have put many animals on the verge of extinction.<br> Despite being relatively common in nature, the extinction process is being intensified by human action.</P>

        <p>A report developed by the United Nations (UN) concluded that around one million species are at risk of extinction,<br> which reinforces the need to create more conservation programs.</p>
