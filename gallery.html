        <h2>Onça-Pintada</h2>
        <img src="./imagens/onca-pintada.webp" alt="Onça-Pintada">
            <p>The Onça-Pintada (Panthera onca), (Panthera onca), is considered the largest cat in the Americas and is on the list<br> of endangered animals in the vulnerable category. Flagship species of Brazil, the jaguar is considered important for<br> the conservation actions of several Brazilian phytophysiognomies (Atlantic Forest, Amazon Forest, Cerrado and Pantanal).<br>
            <br>
            Habitat destruction and poaching are the main causes of the severe reduction in the jaguar population. They are classified<br> by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) and by IBAMA as a vulnerable species and are part of Appendix<br> I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), which lists endangered species.<br> extinction, whose trade will only be allowed in exceptional circumstances.</p>

            <img src="./imagens/mico-leão.jpg" alt="Mico Leão Dourado">
            <p>The image of the small primate, about 60 centimeters high, has traveled the world and, since the 70's, is one of the symbols<br> of the fight for the conservation of biological diversity. That's because the golden lion tamarin has long been threatened with extinction.
            <br>
            <br>
            The devastation of the Atlantic Forest almost wiped out the entire population of golden lion tamarins. Originally, the species<br> was found all along the coast of Rio de Janeiro, reaching Espírito Santo. With the intense occupation of the coastal zone in the state,<br> accompanied by logging and agricultural activities, the tamarins are confined to around 20 forest fragments.</p>
